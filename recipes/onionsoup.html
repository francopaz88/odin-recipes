    <h3 class="subtitulo">Description</h3>
    <p>Warm, cozy, and flavorful, this French onion soup is prepared with beef stock and caramelized onions. Top with
        croutons covered in melty Gruyere and Parmesan cheese.â€‹</p>
    <h3 class="subtitulo">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds)</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar </li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced </li>
        <li>8 cups beef stock, chicken stock, or a combination of the two </li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry vermouth or dry white wine </li>
        <li>2 bay leaves </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="subtitulo">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and thinly slice the onions from root to stem. There should be about 10 cups of sliced onions in total.
        </li>
        <li> In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the onions and
            toss to coat with the olive oil.
            Cook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20 minutes.
            Increase the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter and cook,
            stirring often, until the onions start to brown, about 20 to 40 minutes. The amount of time will vary
            depending on your pot, stove, and onions.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of salt. Continue to cook until the
            onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the wine or vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom and sides of the pot,
            deglazing the pot as you go.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a low
            simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
